        <h2>Environmental Policy Statement</h2>

        <p>
          At <strong>Free Drop Limited</strong>, sustainability is not a slogan
          — it is a responsibility. We recognize that every project we undertake
          has an environmental impact, and we are committed to managing that
          impact through innovation, efficiency, and ethical business practices.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our environmental approach is guided by the belief that sustainable
          construction and design can create value — not only for our clients,
          but for our communities and future generations. We integrate
          environmental stewardship into every aspect of our operations,
          ensuring that growth never comes at the cost of the planet.
        </p>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h3>1. Sustainable Operations</h3>
          <p>
            We continuously optimize the way we source, build, and operate.
            Through efficient energy use, responsible material selection, and
            reduced waste generation, we strive to minimize our carbon footprint
            while improving project performance and long-term resilience.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h3>2. Waste Management and Circular Practices</h3>
          <p>
            We promote a circular economy mindset — reducing waste at every
            stage of a project. Materials are reused or recycled wherever
            possible, and our construction teams are trained in waste
            segregation and responsible disposal.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h3>3. Carbon Responsibility</h3>
          <p>
            Free Drop Limited actively pursues carbon reduction through
            efficient logistics, low-emission transportation, and renewable
            energy integration. We partner with suppliers and clients who share
            our commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the
            supply chain.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h3>4. Innovation for a Greener Future</h3>
          <p>
            Innovation drives our sustainability mission. We explore emerging
            technologies and materials that enhance energy efficiency, extend
            product lifecycles, and reduce environmental degradation — ensuring
            that our projects stand as examples of responsible development.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h3>5. Education and Collaboration</h3>
          <p>
            We believe that environmental responsibility is shared. Through
            employee awareness programs, supplier engagement, and community
            initiatives, we build a culture that values accountability,
            collaboration, and continuous learning.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h3>6. Continuous Improvement</h3>
          <p>
            Environmental stewardship is an evolving journey. We regularly
            review our policies, assess performance, and set measurable
            objectives to ensure ongoing improvement. Every project is an
            opportunity to do better — and we take that challenge seriously.
          </p>
